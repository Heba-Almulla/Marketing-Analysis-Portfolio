# Data Analyst Portfolio Project ‚Äì Marketing Analytics

This repository showcases a complete **end-to-end marketing analytics project** combining: 
- **SQL-based data preparation**
- **Power BI interactive dashboards** 
- **Python-powered sentiment analysis**

It demonstrates practical capabilities in:
- Data cleaning and enrichment (SQL)
- Business insights through dashboards (Power BI)
- Text sentiment classification (Python & NLP)
---
## Problem Statement

In a fast-paced marketing environment, businesses struggle to understand:
- Which products convert best?
- Which channels drive the most engagement?
- What‚Äôs the overall customer sentiment across all products? (e.g. *840 Positive reviews, Avg Rating: 3.69*)
- Where do we lose customers in the journey?

This project solves those challenges by building a full-stack analytical workflow that answers:
- **Which campaigns convert?** (e.g. *Hockey Stick: 15.5%*)
- **Which month drives peak conversions?** (e.g. *January: 17.3%*)
- **How is sentiment distributed across reviews?** (e.g. *Positive: 840, Negative: 226, Mixed Negative: 196*)
- **Where in the journey are users dropping off?** (e.g. *Drop-off: 15.2%*)

## Project Structure

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Data-Preparation-Queries.sql` | SQL scripts to clean, enrich, and normalize multiple datasets: product, customer, review, engagement, and customer journey. |
| `Marketing-Analysis-Dashboard.pbix` | Power BI dashboard visualizing KPIs, conversion metrics, sentiment trends, and customer engagement. |
| `Sentiment-Analysis.ipynb` | Python notebook using VADER to analyze customer reviews and classify them by sentiment category and score. |

---

## Data Preparation (SQL)

The SQL script performs:
- **Product Categorization** by price bands (Low, Medium, High)
- **Customer Enrichment** using geography and age segmentation
- **Review Cleaning** by removing extra spaces
- **Engagement Normalization** by extracting views/clicks from mixed strings
- **Clean Customer Journey Data** by removing duplicates and intelligently filling missing durations ‚Äî first using the average for that date, then falling back to the overall average if needed


‚úîÔ∏è **Output Preview:**
- Standardized fields: clean reviews, tagged price categories, filled engagement fields
- Ready-to-analyze datasets for Power BI

## Sentiment Analysis (Python)

The  `Sentiment-Analysis.ipynb` notebook:
- Connects to the SQL database and pulls cleaned review data
- Applies **VADER sentiment analysis**
- Classifies reviews into a **5-level sentiment breakdown** based on both sentiment score and rating:
  - Positive
  - Mixed Positive
  - Mixed Negative
  - Negative
  - Neutral
It also adds:
- `SentimentScore`: VADER compound score (between -1 and 1)
- `SentimentBucket`: One of `0.5 to 1.0`, `0.0 to 0.49`, `-0.49 to 0.0`, or `-1.0 to -0.5`
  
üì§ **Output Saved as CSV**:
The sentiment analysis results are saved in the file:
`fact_customer_reviews_with_sentiment.csv`.
